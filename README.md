 Basic Rules:
  1. A square can be dead or alive
  2. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies of lonliness.
  3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives.
  4. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies of hunger.
  5. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

  All cells on the grid are evaluted simultaneously to produce the next generation.
